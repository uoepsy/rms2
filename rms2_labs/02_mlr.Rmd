In this block of exercises, we move from the simple linear regression model (one outcome variable, one explanatory variable) to the _multiple regression model_ (one outcome variable, multiple explanatory variables). Everything we just learned about simple linear regression can be extended (with minor modification) to the multiple regression model. The key conceptual difference is that for simple linear regression we think of the distribution of errors at some fixed value of the explanatory variable, and for multiple linear regression, we think about the distribution of errors at fixed set of values for all our explanatory variables.

> **Research question**  
> Reseachers are interested in the relationship between psychological wellbeing and time spent outdoors.  
The researchers know that other aspects of peoples' lifestyles such as how much social interaction they have can influence their mental well-being. They would like to study whether there is a relationship between well-being and time spent outdoors *after* taking into account the relationship between well-being and social interactions.  

<!-- We previously used simple linear regression to examine whether score on the WMBWS was related to the amount of time spent outdoors (self-reported as the average number of hours per week). We will now extend this and build a multiple regression model which we can use to predict WEMWBS score based on both outdoor time *and* number of social interactions.   -->

__Description__

Researchers interviewed 32 participants, selected at random from the population of residents of Edinburgh & Lothians. They used the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being. The scale is scored by summing responses to each item, with items answered on a 1 to 5 Likert scale. The minimum scale score is 14 and the maximum is 70.  
The researchers also asked participants to estimate the average number of hours they spend outdoors each week, the average number of social interactions they have each week (whether on-line or in-person), and whether they believe that they stick to a routine throughout the week (Yes/No).  

The data in `wellbeing.csv` contain five attributes collected from a random sample of $n=32$ hypothetical residents over Edinburgh & Lothians, and include:

- `wellbeing`: Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being. The scale is scored by summing responses to each item, with items answered on a 1 to 5 Likert scale. The minimum scale score is 14 and the maximum is 70.  
- `outdoor_time`: Self report estimated number of hours per week spent outdoors  
- `social_int`: Self report estimated number of social interactions per week (both online and in-person)
- `routine`: Binary Yes/No response to the question "Do you follow a daily routine throughout the week?"
- `location`: Location of primary residence (City, Suburb, Rural)

**Hint:** We can create a correlation matrix easily by giving the `cor()` function a dataframe. However, we only want to give it 3 columns here. Think about how we select specific columns, either using `select()`, or giving the column numbers inside `[]`.

There is also a weak positive correlation between weekly outdoor time and the weekly number of social interactions.  
::: 

<br>
Note that there is a weak correlation between our two explanatory variables (outdoor_time and social_int). We will return to how this might affect our model when later on we look at the assumptions of multiple regression.  
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(5)`
The scatterplots we created above show moderate, positive, and linear relationships both between outdoor time and wellbeing, and between numbers of social interactions and wellbeing.

Specify the form of your model, where $x_1$ = weekly outdoor time, $x_2$ = weekly numbers of social interactions and $y$ = scores on the WEMWBS.  
What are the _parameters_ of the model. How do we denote _parameter estimates_?  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
A model for the relationship between $x_1$ = weekly outdoor time, $x_2$ = weekly numbers of social interactions and $y$ = scores on the WEMWBS is given by:
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon \\ \quad \\ \text{where} \quad \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma) \text{ independently}
$$

In the model specified above,

- $\mu_{y|x_1, x_2} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x_2$ represents the systematic part of the model giving the mean of $y$ at each combination of values of $x_1$ and $x_2$;
- $\epsilon$ represents the error (deviation) from that mean, and the errors are independent from one another.  
  
  
The parameters of our model are:

+ $\beta_0$ (The intercept);
+ $\beta_1$ (The slope across values of $x_1$);
+ $\beta_2$ (The slope across values of $x_2$);  
+ $\sigma$ (The standard deviation of the errors).

When we estimate these parameters from the available data, we have a _fitted model_ (recall that the h$\hat{\textrm{a}}$ts are used to distinguish our _estimates_ from the _true unknown parameters_): 
$$
\widehat{Wellbeing} = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 \cdot Outdoor Time + \hat \beta_2 \cdot Social Interactions
$$
And we have residuals $\hat \epsilon = y - \hat y$ which are the deviations from the observed values and our model-predicted responses.  
`r solend()`


:::frame   
__Visual__

Note that for simple linear regression we talked about our model as a _line_ in 2 dimensions: the systematic part $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x$ defined a line for $\mu_y$ across the possible values of $x$, with $\epsilon$ as the random deviations from that line. But in multiple regression we have more than two variables making up our model. 

In this particular case of three variables (one outcome + two explanatory), we can think of our model as a _regression surface_ (See Figure \@ref(fig:regsurf)). The systematic part of our model defines the surface across a range of possible values of both $x_1$ *and* $x_2$. Deviations from the surface are determined by the random error component, $\hat \epsilon$.  

```{r regsurf, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Regression surface for wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, from two different angles", out.width="100%"}
fit<-lm(wellbeing~outdoor_time+social_int, data=mwdata)
steps=50
outdoor_time <- with(mwdata, seq(min(outdoor_time),max(outdoor_time),length=steps))
social_int <- with(mwdata, seq(min(social_int),max(social_int),length=steps))
newdat <- expand.grid(outdoor_time=outdoor_time, social_int=social_int)
wellbeing <- matrix(predict(fit, newdat), steps, steps)


par(mfrow=c(1,2))
p <- persp(outdoor_time,social_int,wellbeing, theta = 35,phi=10, col = NA)
obs <- with(mwdata, trans3d(outdoor_time,social_int, wellbeing, p))
pred <- with(mwdata, trans3d(outdoor_time, social_int, fitted(fit), p))
points(obs, col = "red", pch = 16)
#points(pred, col = "blue", pch = 16)
segments(obs$x, obs$y, pred$x, pred$y)

p <- persp(outdoor_time,social_int,wellbeing, theta = -35,phi=10, col = NA)
obs <- with(mwdata, trans3d(outdoor_time,social_int, wellbeing, p))
pred <- with(mwdata, trans3d(outdoor_time, social_int, fitted(fit), p))
points(obs, col = "red", pch = 16)
#points(pred, col = "blue", pch = 16)
segments(obs$x, obs$y, pred$x, pred$y)

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

Don't worry about trying to figure out how to visualise it if we had any more explanatory variables! We can only concieve of 3 spatial dimensions. One could imagine this surface changing over time, which would bring in a 4th dimension, but beyond that, it's not worth trying!.

So far for our multiple regression model we have completed the first two steps (**Choose** and **Fit**) in that we have:  

1. Explored/visualised our data and specified our model
2. fitted the model in R.   

We are going to skip straight to the **Use** step here, and move to interpreting our parameter estimates and construct confidence intervals around them. Please note that this when conducting real analyses, this would be an inappropriate thing to do. We will look at how to **Assess** whether a multiple regression model meets assumptions in a later lab.

__Interpretation of Muliple Regression Coefficients__

You'll hear a lot of different ways that people explain multiple regression coefficients.  
For the model $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon$, the estimate $\hat \beta_1$ will often be reported as:  
  
the increase in $y$ for a one unit increase in $x_1$ when...

- holding the effect of $x_2$ constant.
- controlling for differences in $x_2$.
- partialling out the effects of $x_2$.
- holding $x_2$ equal. 
- accounting for effects of $x_2$. 

:::int
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(mdl1)$coefficients
```

The coefficient `r round(coef(mdl1)[2],2)` of weekly outdoor time for predicting wellbeing score says that among those with the same number of social interactions per week, those who have one additional hour of outdoor time tend to, on average, score `r round(coef(mdl1)[2],2)` higher on the WEMWBS wellbeing scale. The multiple regression coefficient measures that average _conditional_ relationship.

`r qbegin("8 - Advanced")`
Within what distance from the model predicted values (the regression surface) would we expect 95% of wEMWBS wellbeing scores to be?

**Hint:** either `sigma(mdl1)` or part of the output from `summary(mdl1)` will help you here.  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
The estimated standard deviation of the errors is $\hat \sigma$ = `r round(sigma(mdl1),2)`. We would expect 95% of wellbeing scores to be within about `r round(sigma(mdl1)*2,1)` ($2 \hat \sigma$) from the model fit.

+ When _holding the number of social interactions per week constant_, each one hour increase in weekly outdoor time is associated with a difference in wellbeing scores between `r round(confint(mdl1, level=.95)[2,1],2)` and `r round(confint(mdl1, level=.95)[2,2],2)`, on average.

# ~ Numeric + Categorical

Let's do that again, but paying careful attention to where and how the process differs when we have a _categorical_ (or "qualitative") predictor.

> Suppose that the group of researchers were instead wanting to study the relationship between well-being and time spent outdoors after taking into account the relationship between well-being and _having a routine_. 


`r qbegin(10)`
We have already visualised the marginal distribution of weekly outdoor time in an earlier question, as well as its relationship with wellbeing scores.  
Produce visualisations of:  

1. the distribution of the `routine` variable
2. the relationship between `routine` and `wellbeing`. 

**Note:** We cannot visualise the distribution of `routine` as a density curve or boxplot, because it is a _categorical_ variable (observations can only take one of a set of discrete response values).  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
`geom_bar()` will count the number of observations falling into each unique level of the routine variable:
```{r, fig.cap="Marginal distribution plots of Routine (y/n)"}
ggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = routine)) +
  geom_bar()+
  labs(x = "Routine", y = "Frequency")
```

We might plot the relationship between routine and wellbeing as two boxplots:
```{r, fig.cap="Relationship between wellbeing and presence of routine"}
ggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = routine, y = wellbeing)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x = "Routine", y = "Wellbeing score (WEMWBS)")
```
`r solend()`  

:::frame  
__Categorical predictors__

When we have a _categorical_ explanatory variable such as this one, what actually gets inputted into our model is a number of _dummy variables_ which are numeric variables that represents categorical data.  

For a categorical variable with $k$ levels, we can express it in $k-1$ dummy variables.  
For example, the "species" column below has three levels, and can be expressed by the two variables "species_dog" and "species_parrot":  
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
data.frame(
  species = c("cat","cat","dog","parrot","dog","cat","..."),
  species_dog = c(0,0,1,0,1,0,"..."),
  species_parrot = c(0,0,0,1,0,0,"...")
)
```

+ The "cat" level is expressed whenever both the "species_dog" and "species_parrot" variables are 0.
+ The "dog" level is expressed whenever the "species_dog" variable is 1 and the "species_parrot" variable is 0.
+ The "parrot" level is expressed whenever the "species_dog" variable is 0 and the "species_parrot" variable is 1.  

R will do all of this re-expression for us. If we include in our model a categorical explanatory variable with 4 different levels, the model will estimate 3 parameters - one for each dummy variable. We can interpret the parameter estimates (the coefficients we obtain using `coefficients()`,`coef()` or `summary()`) as the estimated increase in the outcome variable associated with an increase of one in each dummy variable (holding all other variables equal). Note that in the above example, an increase in 1 of "species_dog" is the difference between a "cat" and a "dog". An increase in one of "species_parrot" is the difference between a "cat" and a "parrot". We think of the "cat" category in this example as the _reference level_ - it is the category against which other categories are compared against. 

:::  


`r qbegin(11)`
Fit the multiple regression model below using `lm()`, and assign it to an object named `mdl2`. Examine the summary output of the model. 

$$
Wellbeing = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot OutdoorTime + \beta_2 \cdot Routine + \epsilon
$$
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
mdl2 <- lm(wellbeing ~ 1 + outdoor_time + routine, data = mwdata)
summary(mdl2)
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(12)`
$\hat \beta_0$ (the intercept) is the estimated average wellbeing score associated with zero hours of weekly outdoor time and zero in the routine variable.  

What group is the intercept the estimated wellbeing score for when they have zero hours of outdoor time? Why (think about what zero in the routine variable means)?  

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
As you can see in the output of the model, we have a coefficient called `routineRoutine`. This is the parameter estimate for a dummy variable which has been inputted into the model. The `lm()` function will automatically name the dummy variables (and therefore the coefficients) according to what level is identified by the 1. It names them `<variable><Level>`, so we can tell that `routineRoutine` is 1 for "Routine" and 0 for "No Routine".  

The intercept is therefore the estimated wellbeing score for those with No Routine and zero hours of outdoor time.   
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(13)`
In the previous example, we had a visualisation of our model as a regression surface (Figure \@ref(fig:regsurf)).  
Here, one of our explanatory variables has only two possible responses. How might we visualise the model?    

a. one line
a. one surface
a. two lines
a. two surfaces
a. a curved (not flat) surface 

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
We can visualise the model $\widehat{Wellbeing} = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 \cdot OutdoorTime + \hat \beta_2 \cdot Routine$ as two lines.  
Each line represents the model predicted values for wellbeing scores across the range of weekly outdoor time, with one line for those who report having "Routine" and one for those with "No Routine".  
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(14)`
Get a pen and paper, and sketch out the plot shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-annotate).  

```{r plot-annotate, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Multiple regression model: Wellbeing ~ Outdoor Time + Routine"}

Annotate your plot with labels for each of parameter estimates from your model: 

| Parameter Estimate   |      Model Coefficient      |  Estimate |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|

+ A is the vertical distance between the red and blue lines (the lines are parallel, so this distance is the same wherever you cut it on the x-axis).  
+ B is the point at which the blue line cuts the y-axis.  
+ C is the vertical increase (increase on the y-axis) for the blue line associated with a 1 unit increase on the x-axis (the lines are parallel, so this is the same for the red line).

+ A = $\hat \beta_2$ = `routineRoutine` coefficient = `r round(coef(mdl2)[3],2)`
+ B = $\hat \beta_0$ = `(Intercept)` coefficient  = `r round(coef(mdl2)[1],2)`
+ C = $\hat \beta_1$ = `outdoor_time` coefficient = `r round(coef(mdl2)[2],2)`

`r qbegin(15)`
Load the __sjPlot__ package using `library(sjPlot)` and try running the code below. (You may already have the __sjPlot__ package installed from previous exercises on simple linear regression, if not, you will need to install it first).  

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot_model(mdl2)
plot_model(mdl2, type = "pred")
plot_model(mdl2, type = "pred",  terms=c("outdoor_time","routine"), show.data=TRUE)
```

What do you think each one is showing?  

:::frame
The `plot_model` function (and the __sjPlot__ package) can do a lot of different things. Most packages in R come with tutorials (or "vignettes"), for instance: https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/articles/plot_model_estimates.html 
:::

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
library(sjPlot)
plot_model(mdl2)
```
These are the parameter estimates (the $\hat \beta$'s), and the confidence intervals. 
```{r}
confint(mdl2)
```

When we add `type="pred"` we are asking for the predicted values. It will provide a separate plot for each explanatory variable, showing the predicted values at each level of that variable:
```{r}
plot_model(mdl2, type = "pred")
```

We can combine these into one plot, and ask it to show the raw data as well:
```{r}
plot_model(mdl2, type = "pred",  terms=c("outdoor_time","routine"), show.data=TRUE)
```
`r solend()`
