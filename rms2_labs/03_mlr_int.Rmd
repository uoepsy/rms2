# ~ Numeric * Categorical


`r qbegin(1)`  
Reseachers have become interested in how the number of social interactions might influence mental health and wellbeing differently for those living in rural communities compared to those in cities and suburbs. They want to assess whether the effect of social interactions on wellbeing _is moderated by_ (depends upon) whether or not a person lives in a rural area.  

Create a new RMarkdown, load the **tidyverse** package read in the wellbeing data into R.  
The data is available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeing.csv".  

Count the number of respondents in each location (City/Location/Rural).   

**Open-ended:** Do you think there is enough data to answer this question?

mwdata %>% count(location)
```

+ We have only 7 respondents who are from a rural location, and 25 from the city & suburbs. Intuitively, this doesn't seem very many to rely on as representative of the population of those living in rural areas in Edinburgh & Lothians. Another thing to think about is that we probably don't expect _large_ differences between rural and city dwellers in the effect of social interaction on wellbeing (i.e., we might not expect differences in these sub-groups to be stronger than the overall relationship between social interaction and wellbeing).

> **Research Question:** 
> Does the relationship between number of social interactions and mental wellbeing differ between rural and non-rural residents?  

To investigate how the relationship between the number of social interactions and mental wellbeing might be different for those living in rural communities, the researchers conduct a new study, collecting data from 200 randomly selected residents of the Edinburgh & Lothian postcodes.

The data is available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeing_rural.csv.  

__Description__

From the Edinburgh & Lothians, 100 city/suburb residences and 100 rural residences were chosen at random and contacted to participate in the study. The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), was used to measure mental health and well-being. 
Participants filled out a questionnaire including items concerning: estimated average number of hours spent outdoors each week, estimated average number of social interactions each week (whether on-line or in-person), whether a daily routine is followed (yes/no). For those respondents who had an activity tracker app or smart watch, they were asked to provide their average weekly number of steps.  
  
The data in `wellbeing_rural.csv` contain seven attributes collected from a random sample of $n=200$ hypothetical residents over Edinburgh & Lothians, and include:  

- `wellbeing`: Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being. The scale is scored by summing responses to each item, with items answered on a 1 to 5 Likert scale. The minimum scale score is 14 and the maximum is 70.  
- `outdoor_time`: Self report estimated number of hours per week spent outdoors  
- `social_int`: Self report estimated number of social interactions per week (both online and in-person)
- `routine`: Binary 1=Yes/0=No response to the question "Do you follow a daily routine throughout the week?"
- `location`: Location of primary residence (City, Suburb, Rural)
- `steps_k`: Average weekly number of steps in thousands (as given by activity tracker if available)
- `age`: Age in years of respondent

Specify a multiple regression model to answer the research question.  
Read in the data, and assign it the name "mwdata2". Then fully explore the variables and relationships which are going to be used in your analysis.   


> "Except in special circumstances, a model including a product term for interaction between two explanatory variables should also include terms with each of the explanatory variables individually, even though their coefficients may not be significantly different from zero. Following this rule avoids the logical inconsistency of saying that the effect of $X_1$ depends on the level of $X_2$ but that there is no effect of $X_1$."

+ **Tip 1:** Install the `psych` package (remember to use the console, not your script to install packages), and then load it (load it in your script). The `pairs.panels()` function will plot all variables in a dataset against one another. This will save you the time you would have spent creating individual plots.  
+ **Tip 2:** Check the "location" variable. It currently has three levels (Rural/Suburb/City), but we only want two (Rural/Not Rural). You'll need to fix this. One way to do this would be to use `ifelse()` to define a variable which takes one value ("Rural") if the observation meets from some condition, or another value ("Not Rural") if it does not. Type `?ifelse` in the **console** if you want to see the help function. You can use it to add a new variable either inside `mutate()`, or using `data$new_variable_name <- ifelse(test, x, y)` syntax.  

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
To address the research question, we are going to fit the following model, where $y$ = wellbeing; $x_1$ = weekly outdoor time; and $x_2$ = whether or not the respondent lives in a rural location or not. 
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_1 + \beta_2 \cdot x_2 + \beta_3 \cdot x_1 \cdot x_2 + \epsilon \\ 
\quad \\ \text{where} \quad \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma) \text{ independently}
$$

First we read in the data, and take a quick look at our variables:
```{r}
mwdata2 <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeing_rural.csv")
summary(mwdata2)
```

First let's create a new variable for Rural/Not Rural
```{r}
mwdata2 <- 
  mwdata2 %>% 
  mutate(
    isRural = ifelse(location == "rural", "rural","not rural")
  )
```

Now let's use `psych::pairs.panels()` function.  
We could use it on the whole dataset, but for now we'll just do it on the variables we're interested in:
```{r}
library(psych)
pairs.panels(mwdata2 %>% select(wellbeing, social_int, isRural))
```

`r qbegin(4)`
Fit your model using `lm()`, and assign it as an object with the name "rural_mod".   

**Hint:** When fitting a regression model in R with two explanatory variables A and B, and their interaction, these two are equivalent:

:::frame
__Interpreting coefficients for A and B in the presence of an interaction A:B__   

When you include an interaction between $x_1$ and $x_2$ in a regression model, you are estimating the extent to which the effect of $x_1$ on $y$ is different across the values of $x_2$.  

What this means is that the effect of $x_1$ on $y$ *depends on/is conditional upon* the value of $x_2$.  
(and vice versa, the effect of $x_2$ on $y$ is different across the values of $x_1$).   
This means that we can no longer talk about the "effect of $x_1$ _holding $x_2$ constant_". Instead we can talk about a _marginal effect_ of $x_1$ on $y$ at a specific value of $x_2$. 

:::red
When we fit the model $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot x_1 + \beta_2 \cdot x_2 + \beta_3 \cdot x_1 \cdot x_2 + \epsilon$ using `lm()`:  

- the parameter estimate $\hat \beta_1$ is the _marginal effect_ of $x_1$ on $y$ where $x_2 = 0$  
- the parameter estimate $\hat \beta_2$ is the _marginal effect_ of $x_2$ on $y$ where $x_1 = 0$  
:::

<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<small>
__side note:__ Regardless of whether or not there is an interaction term in our model, all parameter estimates in multiple regression are "conditional" in the sense that they are dependent upon the inclusion of other variables in the model. For instance, in $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon$ the coefficient $\hat \beta_1$ is conditional upon holding $x_2$ constant.

__Interpreting the interaction term A:B__  

The coefficient for an interaction term can be thought of as providing an _adjustment to the slope._   
  
In our model: $\text{wellbeing} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot\text{social-interactions} + \beta_2\cdot\text{isRural} + \beta_3\cdot\text{social-interactions}\cdot\text{isRural} + \epsilon$, we have a numeric*categorical interaction.  
The estimate $\hat \beta_3$ is the adjustment to the slope $\hat \beta_1$ to be made for the individuals in the $\text{isRural}=1$ group.

The data is available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/scs_study.csv

__Description__

Data from 656 participants containing information on scores on each trait of a Big 5 personality measure, their perception of their own social rank, and their scores on a measure of depression.  

The data in `scs_study.csv` contain seven attributes collected from a random sample of $n=656$ participants: 

- `zo`: Openness (Z-scored), measured on the Big-5 Aspects Scale (BFAS)
- `zc`: Conscientiousness (Z-scored), measured on the Big-5 Aspects Scale (BFAS)
- `ze`: Extraversion (Z-scored), measured on the Big-5 Aspects Scale (BFAS)
- `za`: Agreeableness (Z-scored), measured on the Big-5 Aspects Scale (BFAS)
- `zn`: Neuroticism (Z-scored), measured on the Big-5 Aspects Scale (BFAS)
- `scs`: Social Comparison Scale - An 11-item scale that measures an individual’s perception of their social rank, attractiveness and belonging relative to others. The scale is scored as a sum of the 11 items (each measured on a 5-point scale), with higher scores indicating more favourable perceptions of social rank.
- `dass`: Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale - The DASS-21 includes 21 items, each measured on a 4-point scale. The score is derived from the sum of all 21 items, with higher scores indicating higher a severity of symptoms.

__Refresher: Z-scores__

When we __standardise__ a variable, we re-express each value as the distance from the mean _in units of standard deviations._ These transformed values are called __z-scores.__  

To transform a given value $x_i$ into a __z-score__ $z_i$, we simply calculate the distance from $x_i$ to the mean, $\bar{x}$, and divide this by the standard deviation, $s$:    
$$
z_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s}
$$

A Z-score of a value is the number of standard deviations below/above the mean that the value falls.

`r qbegin(9)`
Run the code below. It takes the dataset, and uses the `cut()` function to add a new variable called "zn_group", which is the "zn" variable split into 4 groups.  
<div style="margin-left:15px">
_Remember:_ we have re-assign this output as the name of the dataset (the `scs_study <- ` bit at the beginning) to make these changes occur in our __environment__ (the top-right window of Rstudio). If we didn't have the first line, then it would simply print the output.   
</div>

```{r}
scs_study <-
  scs_study %>%
  mutate(
    zn_group = cut(zn, 4)
  )

We can see how it has split the "zn" variable by plotting the two against one another:  
(Note that the levels of the new variable are named according to the cut-points).
```{r}
ggplot(data = scs_study, aes(x = zn_group, y = zn)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Plot the relationship between scores on the SCS and scores on the DASS-21, _for each group of the variable we just created._  
How does the pattern change? Does it suggest an interaction?  

**Tip:** Rather than creating four separate plots, you might want to map some feature of the plot to the variable we created in the data, or make use of `facet_wrap()`/`facet_grid()`.  
`r qend()`

```

The relationship between SCS scores and DASS-21 scores appears to be different between these groups. For those with a relatively high neuroticism score, the relationship seems stronger, while for those with a low neuroticism score there is almost no discernable relationship. 
This suggests an interaction - the relationship of DASS-21 ~ SCS differs across the values of neuroticism! 
`r solend()`

:::frame

Cutting one of the explanatory variables up into groups essentially turns a numeric variable into a categorical one. We did this just to make it easier to visualise how a relationship changes across the values of another variable, because we can imagine a separate line for the relationship between SCS and DASS-21 scores for each of the groups of neuroticism. However, in grouping a numeric variable like this we lose information. Neuroticism is measured on a continuous scale, and we want to capture how the relationship between SCS and DASS-21 changes across that continuum (rather than cutting it into chunks).   
We could imagine cutting it into more and more chunks (see Figure \@ref(fig:reglinescut)), until what we end up with is a an infinite number of lines - i.e., a three-dimensional plane/surface (recall that in for a multiple regression model with 2 explanatory variables, we can think of the model as having three-dimensions). The inclusion of the interaction term simply results in this surface no longer being necessarily flat. You can see this in Figure \@ref(fig:3dint).

Recall that the coefficients `zn` and `scs` from our model now reflect the estimated change in the outcome associated with an increase of 1 in the explanatory variables, _when the other variable is zero._  

**Think** - what is 0 in each variable? what is an increase of 1? Are these meaningful? Would you suggest recentering either variable?
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
The neuroticism variable `zn` is Z-scored, which means that 0 is the mean (it is mean-centered), and 1 is a standard deviation.   
  
The Social Comparison Scale variable `scs` is the raw-score. Looking back at the description of the variables, we can work out that the minimum possible score is 11 (if people respond 1 for each of the 11 questions) and the maximum is 55 (if they respond 5 for all questions). Is it meaningful/useful to talk about estimated effects for people who score 0? Not really.  

But we can make it so that zero represents something else, such as the minimum score, or the mean score. For instance, `scs_study$scs - 11` will subtract 11 from the scores, making zero the minimum possible score on the scale.
