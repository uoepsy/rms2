# Instructions
+ There will now be a small set of questions. 

--

+ Pause the video to think about them and write your answers down. 

--

+ The answers will be shown immediately afterwards.

--

+ This is to check learning and is not assessed.

# Question 1

.pull-left[
Attempt to answer this question without doing any calculations.

The table to the right contains partial information on the $SS_{TOTAL}$, $SS_{MODEL}$ and $SS_{RESIDUAL}$ for three models.

**Rank order the models in terms of their $R^2$ value, from largest to smallest.**
]


.pull-right[

```{r}
tibble(
  SS = c("Model", "Residual", "Total"),
  M1 = c("",25,30),
  M2 = c(10,"",20),
  M3 = c(5,15,"")
) %>%
  kable(.)
```

# Question 1: Answer

1. M2
2. M3
3. M1

+ The idea here is to get a feel for the ratio's. 

+ M2 is the easiest to initial "see". 10/20 = .5

+ M3 is quick to see has the same total, but smaller model sums of squares. So it has to be below M2.

+ You can also see M1 has to have the same model sums of squares as M3, but it has a larger total sums of squares. The to associated ratio must be smaller than M3.

# The end.

+ If you are happy with your answers, move on to the next video/task.

+ If you are unclear on anything, either pop along to office hours, or post a question on the discussion board.
