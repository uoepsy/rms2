# Instructions
+ There will now be a small set of questions. 

--

+ Pause the video to think about them and write your answers down. 

--

+ The answers will be shown immediately afterwards.

--

+ This is to check learning and is not assessed.

# Question 1

I conduct a study where I measure the time it takes (in minutes) for a participant to complete a task, where the score for the task is the number of errors they make. 

My outcome measure is errors, and my predictor is time. 

I get the following results:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
colnames(res) <- c("x1", "y1","time", "error","x3", "y3")
q1 <- lm(error ~ time, res)
summary(q1)$coefficients
```


**Write an interpretation of both the intercept and the coefficient for time.**

---
# Question 1: Answer

+ **Intercept**: For someone who spends zero time on the task the expected number of errors is -0.002 

+ **time**: For every minute someone spends on the task, the number of errors decreases by -0.46


---
# Question 2

A second set of researchers runs the same study, and conducts the same analysis. 

There results are shown below:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
colnames(res) <- c("time", "error","x2", "y2","x3", "y3")
q2 <- lm(error ~ time, res)
summary(q2)$coefficients
```


**Write an interpretation of both the intercept and the coefficient for time.**


---
# Question 2: Answer

+ **Intercept**: For someone who spends zero time on the task the expected number of errors is -0.06 

+ **time**: For every minute someone spends on the task, the number of errors increases by 0.60


---
# Question 3

**How do the results from question 1 and question 2 differ? Which results make most sense given the variables measured?**



---
# Question 3: Answer

+ In study 1, increased time is associated with a decrease in errors.

+ In study 2, increased time is associated with an increase in errors.

+ Study 1 and study 2 provide opposite results. 

+ The results of this study were not replicable. 

+ Intuitively, the results in study 1 make more conceptual sense.



---
# The end.

+ If you are happy with your answers, move on to the next video/task.

+ If you are unclear on anything, either pop along to office hours, or post a question on the discussion board.
