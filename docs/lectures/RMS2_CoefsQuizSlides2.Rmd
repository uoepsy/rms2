# Instructions
+ There will now be a small set of questions. 

--

+ Pause the video to think about them and write your answers down. 

--

+ The answers will be shown immediately afterwards.

--

+ This is to check learning and is not assessed.

---
# Question 1

What is the standard error?

a. variance of the normal distribution

b. standard deviation of the predictor

c. standard deviation of the sampling distribution

d. variance of the sampling distribution



---
# Question 1: Answer

c


If this questions seems like jibberish, before continuing, go back to week 1 materials and look again at the recap material on sampling and hypothesis testing. Note down any questions, and come to office hours to chat them over.


---
# The end.

+ If you are happy with your answers, move on to the next video/task.

+ If you are unclear on anything, either pop along to office hours, or post a question on the discussion board.
