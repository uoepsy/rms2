# Topics for today
+ Conceptualise categorical interactions using plots 
  + Work through the lecture handout

+ Show the calculations for categorical interactions with effects code
  + Highlight these are differences in simple effects
  + Parallel to the idea of simple slopes.
  
+ Practical example in R

+ Coding of categorical interactions with dummy vs effects codes.

# Our results
```{r}
m4 <- lm(SWB ~ Treatment + Hospital + Treatment*Hospital, data = hosp_tbl)
anova(m4)
```

---
# Our results
```{r}
m4sum <- summary(m4)
round(m4sum$coefficients,2)
```

---
# But where do we go next?
+ It is typically a bad idea to focus on main effects in the presence of an interaction.
  + The interaction means the effect of the condition differs dependent on the interacting variable.

+ So we need to understand more about the interaction

+ We will use the `emmeans` package to explore this futher:
  + We will start by looking at the visualizations
  + And then consider the simple effects

# Visualizing the interaction

# Time for a break

**If the interaction plots are a little confusing, take a break and read the interactions handout**

# Welcome Back!

**Look into the interaction further**

# Simple Effects
+ We noted earlier that simple contrasts/effects consider the effect of one condition at a specific level of the other.
  + Is there an effect of `Hospital` for those receiving `Treatment A`? (and so on for all combinations)
  + Or, put another way, is there a difference in SWB between Hospitals 1 and 2 for people receiving Treatment A

+ We also know an interaction is defined as the change in the effect of one variable given the value of another.
  + So here, value = a specific level.
  + So by considering the simple effects, we can identify at which levels of the interacting condition we see different effects.

# Simple Effects with `emmeans`

```{r}
m4_emm <- emmeans(m4, ~Treatment*Hospital)
m4_simple1 <- pairs(m4_emm, simple = "Hospital")
m4_simple1
```

---
# Simple Effects with `emmeans`

```{r}
m4_simple2 <- pairs(m4_emm, simple = "Treatment")
m4_simple2
```


---
# Simple effects with plots

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
emmip(m4, Treatment ~ Hospital)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
m4_simple1
```

]

# Simple effects with plots

.pull-left[

# Coding interactions
+ We noted last time that to fully code an interaction between categorical variables in a linear model, we need (r-1)(c-1) variables.

+ This comes from:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tibble::tribble(
   ~V1, ~V2, ~V3, 
  "TreatA", "10.80",  "7.85",
  "TreatB", "9.43",  "13.11",
  "TreatC", "10.10",  "7.98",
  ), col.names = c("", "Hosp1",  "Hosp2"))
```

+ So how does this look for dummy and effects codes.

# For dummy coding

$$y_{ijk} = b_0 + \underbrace{(b_1D_1 + b_2D_2)}_{\text{Treatment}} + \underbrace{b_3D_3}_{\text{Hospital}} + \underbrace{b_4D_{13} + b_5D_{23}}_{\text{Interactions}} + \epsilon_{i}$$


```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibble(
  Treatment = c("A", "A", "B", "B", "C", "C"),
  Hospital = rep(c("Hosp1", "Hosp2"),3),
  D1 = c(0,0,1,1,0,0),
  D2 = c(0,0,0,0,1,1),
  D3 = c(0,1,0,1,0,1),
  D13 = c(0,0,0,1,0,0),
  D23 = c(0,0,0,0,0,1)
)
```

# Interpretation (nulls) with dummy coding
```{r, echo=FALSE}
round(m4sum$coefficients,2)
```

+ $b_0$ = Mean of treatment A hospital 1 is equal to 0.
+ $b_1$ = Difference between Treatment B and Treatment A in Hospital 1 is 0.
+ $b_2$ = Difference between Treatment C and Treatment A in Hospital 1 is 0.
+ $b_3$ = Difference between Treatment A in Hospital 1 and Hospital 2 is 0.
+ $b_4$ = Difference between Treatment A and Treatment B, is different in Hospital 1 and Hospital 2
+ $b_5$ = Difference between Treatment A and Treatment C, is different in Hospital 1 and Hospital 2


---
# For effects coding


$$y_{ijk} = b_0 + \underbrace{(b_1E_1 + b_2E_2)}_{\text{Treatment}} + \underbrace{b_3E_3}_{\text{Hospital}} + \underbrace{b_4E_{13} + b_5E_{23}}_{\text{Interactions}} + \epsilon_{i}$$


```{r, echo=FALSE}

  Treatment = c("A", "A", "B", "B", "C", "C"),
  Hospital = rep(c("Hosp1", "Hosp2"),3),
  E1 = c(1,1,0,0,-1,-1),

# Run model with effects coding

```

+ $b_0$ = Grand mean.
+ $b_1$ = Difference between row marginal for treatment A and the grand mean. 
+ $b_2$ = Difference between row marginal for treatment B and the grand mean.
+ $b_3$ = Difference between column marginal for Hospital 1 and the grand mean.

# Summary of today

+ Look at...
  + how to use `emmeans` to visualize interactions
  + probed the simple effects
  + considered the structure of the linear model with interactions between cateorical variables
  + considered the interpretation of the individual coefficients

+ Next up (and last for this week)....
  + a brief word on assumptions.
