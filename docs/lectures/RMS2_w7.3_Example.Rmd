# Topics for today
+ Testing ANOVA effects in linear models

+ Introduce our example for the next two weeks

+ One-way ANOVA example

---
# Hypotheses we test in ANOVA

+ One-way ANOVA:
  + **Main effect (tests overall effect of a condition; F-tests )**
  + Contrasts (tests differences between specific group means; $\beta$ )

--

+ Factorial ANOVA:
  + Simple contrasts/effects
  + Interactions (categorical*categorical)
  + Main effects

---
# Example
+ The data comes from a study into patient care in a paediatric wards. 

+ A researcher was interested in whether the subjective well-being of patients differed dependent on the post-operation treatment schedule they were given, and the hospital in which they were staying. 

+ **Condition 1**: `Treatment` (Levels: TreatA, TreatB, TreatC.
  
+ **Condition 2**: `Hosp` (Levels: Hosp1, Hosp2). 
  
+ Total sample n = 180 (30 patients in each of 6 groups).
  + Between person design. 

+ **Outcome**: Subjective well-being (SWB)
  + An average of multiple raters (the patient, a member of their family, and a friend). 
  + SWB score ranged from 0 to 20.

# The data
```{r}
hosp_tbl <- read_csv("hospital.csv", col_types = "dff")
hosp_tbl %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

---
# For today

+ As we are discussing one-way ANOVA, today we will just look at the effect of treatment on SWB.

+ What we will show is that:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lm(SWB ~ Treatment, data = hosp_tbl)
```

+ and

```{r, eval=FALSE}
aov(SWB ~ Treatment, data = hosp_tbl)
```

+ are the same.

---
# Descriptive statistics by group

```{r}
hosp_tbl %>%
  select(1:2) %>%
  group_by(Treatment) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = round(mean(SWB)),
    sd = round(sd(SWB),1),
    N = n()
  )
```


---
# Sums of squares for ANOVA and LM
+ Recall that in ANOVA we break down sums of squares


$$SS_{total} = SS_{between} + SS_{within}$$

+ And that $SS_{between}$ refers to the conditions/groups.
  + This group structure is the model. 

+ Hence we have a direct parallel to linear model

$$SS_{total} = SS_{model} + SS_{residual}$$

---
# Total Variation & SS

.pull-left[

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hosp_tbl %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x=Treatment, y=SWB, colour = Treatment, shape = Treatment)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, size = 2) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(hosp_tbl$SWB), lty = 2, colour = "darkgrey") +
  theme_classic() 
```


]


.pull-right[

$$SS_{total} = \sum(Y_{ij} - \bar{Y})^2$$

+ The subscript $ij$ here denotes individuals within groups.

+ Other than this, this is identical to the linear model.

+ It is the sum of the square deviations around the mean (dashed grey line)

]


---
# Between/Model variation & SS


.pull-left[

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gpM <- hosp_tbl %>%
  group_by(Treatment) %>%
  summarise(
    SWB = round(mean(SWB))
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    GM = c(rep(mean(SWB),3))
  )

hosp_tbl %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x=Treatment, y=SWB, colour = Treatment, shape = Treatment)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, size = 2) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(hosp_tbl$SWB), lty = 2, colour = "darkgrey") +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_errorbar(data = gpM, width=0.8,aes(ymax=..y..,ymin=..y..))
```

]


.pull-right[

$$SS_{between} = \sum n(\bar{Y_j} - \bar{Y})^2$$

+ Sum of the squared deviations of the group means from the mean of Y.
  + The solid coloured lines to the dashed grey line

+ For linear model, we stated

$$SS_{Model} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2$$

+ These are equivalent. Remember
  + $\hat{y_i}$ = model predicted value
  + So this is equal to the deviation of the the model predicted value of $y$ for a given value of $x$
  + When we have categorical predictors, the predicted value of $y$ for a given value of $x$ = group mean

]

---
# Within/residual variation & SS


.pull-left[

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gpM <- hosp_tbl %>%
  group_by(Treatment) %>%
  summarise(
    SWB = round(mean(SWB))
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    GM = c(rep(mean(SWB),3))
  )

hosp_tbl %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x=Treatment, y=SWB, colour = Treatment, shape = Treatment)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, size = 2) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(hosp_tbl$SWB), lty = 2, colour = "darkgrey") +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_errorbar(data = gpM, width=0.8,aes(ymax=..y..,ymin=..y..))
```

]


.pull-right[

$$SS_{within} = \sum(Y_{ij} - \bar{Y_j})^2$$
+ Sum of the squared deviations of the individual values from the group mean.

+ For the linear model we stated

$$SS_{Residual} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$
+ And as in the previous slide, these are equivalent because predicted value for a given value of $x$ is the group mean.

+ Or put another way, our model = group means.

# F-test in LM and ANOVA

**ANOVA**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ftest <- tibble(
  SS = c("Between", "Within", "Total"),
  df = c("g-1", "g(n-1)", "gn-1"),
  MS = c("SS between/df between", "SS within/df within", " "),
  Fratio = c("MS between/ MS within", " ", " "),
  pvalue = c("F(df between,df within)", "", "")
)

kable(ftest)%>%
  kable_styling(., full_width = F)
```

+ g = number of levels or groups in condition (g=3)
+ n = number of participants per group (n=60)

+ So here:
  + $df_{between}$ = 3-1 = 2
  + $df_{within}$ = 3*(60-1) = 177
  + $df_{total}$ = (3*60)-1 = 179

---
# F-test in LM and ANOVA

**Linear Model**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ftest <- tibble(
  SS = c("Model", "Residual", "Total"),
  df = c("k", "n-k-1", " n-1"),
  MS = c("SS model/df model", "SS residual/df residual", " "),
  Fratio = c("MS model/ MS residual", " ", " "),
  pvalue = c("F(df model,df residual)", "", "")
)

kable(ftest)%>%
  kable_styling(., full_width = F)
```

+ k = number of predictors
+ n = sample size

+ So here:
  + $df_{model}$ = k = 2
  + $df_{residual}$ = 180-2-1 = 177
  + $df_{total}$ = 180-1 = 179

```{r}
summary(lm(SWB ~ Treatment, data = hosp_tbl))

# Summary of today

+ We introduced our example, and focussed on the effect of the treatments

+ And looked at the calculation of $F$-test

+ Key point:
  + It is exactly the same test.
  + Always keep in mind that the group structure = model
