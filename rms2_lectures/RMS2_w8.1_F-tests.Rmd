# Topics for today
+ Tabulating data from factorial design

+ Recap factorial ANOVA effects of interest.
  + Main effects
  + Simple effects/contrasts
  + Interactions

+ Show the tests of main effects via model comparison $F$-tests

# Example
+ The data comes from a study into patient care in a paediatric wards. 

+ A researcher was interested in whether the subjective well-being of patients differed dependent on the post-operation treatment schedule they were given, and the hospital in which they were staying. 

+ **Condition 1**: `Treatment` (Levels: TreatA, TreatB, TreatC.
  
+ **Condition 2**: `Hosp` (Levels: Hosp1, Hosp2). 
  
+ Total sample n = 180 (30 patients in each of 6 groups).
  + Between person design. 

+ **Outcome**: Subjective well-being (SWB)
  + An average of multiple raters (the patient, a member of their family, and a friend). 
  + SWB score ranged from 0 to 20.

# The data
```{r}
hosp_tbl <- read_csv("hospital.csv", col_types = "dff")
hosp_tbl %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

---
# Table of means

.pull-left[

```{r}
mean(hosp_tbl$SWB)
```



```{r}
aggregate(SWB ~ Treatment + Hospital, 
  hosp_tbl, mean)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
aggregate(SWB ~ Hospital, 
  hosp_tbl, mean)
```

```{r}
aggregate(SWB ~ Treatment, 
  hosp_tbl, mean)
```

]

---
# Table of means

+ All of the above gives us a full table of means

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tibble::tribble(
   ~V1, ~V2, ~V3, ~V4,
  "TreatA", "10.80",  "7.85", "9.33",
  "TreatB", "9.43",  "13.11", "11.27",
  "TreatC", "10.10",  "7.98", "9.04", 
  "Marginal","10.11", "9.65", "9.88"
  ), col.names = c("", "Hosp1",  "Hosp2", "Marginal"))
```

# Hypotheses we test in Factorial ANOVA
+ Main effects
  + An overall, or average, effect of a condition.
  + In our example, is there an effect of `Treatment` ignoring `Hospital` (and vice versa)

+ Simple contrasts/effects
  + An effect of one condition at a specific level of another.
  + Is there an effect of `Hospital` for those receiving `Treatment A`? (and so on for all combinations)

+ Interactions (categorical*categorical)
  + A change in the effect of a condition dependent on the other.
  + Does the effect of `Treatment` differ by `Hospital`


---
# Our model and coefficients
+ The linear model with two categorical variables:

$$y_{ijk} = b_0 + \alpha_i + \tau_j + \epsilon_{ijk}$$
+ where;
  + i = 1 .... g_A,  j = 1 ... g_B,   k = 1... n
  + $y_{ijk}$ is the kth observation of level i of the first factor and level j of the second factor
  + $\alpha_i$ is the effect of the level i of the first factor
  + $\tau_j$ is the effect of level j of the second factor


+ But remember whichever coding scheme we use, we have $g$-1 variables representing the condition.
  + So for `Treatment` we have 2 predictors (D1 & D2)
  + And for `Hospital` we have 1 predictor (D3)
  
+ So we can write this more explicitly:

$$y_{ijk} = b_0 + \underbrace{(b_1D_1 + b_2D_2)}_{\text{Treatment}} + \underbrace{b_3D_3}_{\text{Hospital}} + \epsilon_{i}$$
  
---
# Number of interaction terms
+ To include terms for the interaction, we need to cross each level of one condition with the levels of the other.

+ In general this will mean we need ( $r$-1)( $c$-1) interaction terms
  + where $c$ and $r$ represent the number of levels of each condition.
  + In our case this is (3-1)(2-1) = 2

$$y_{ijk} = b_0 + \underbrace{(b_1D_1 + b_2D_2)}_{\text{Treatment}} + \underbrace{b_3D_3}_{\text{Hospital}} + \underbrace{b_4D_{13} + b_5D_{23}}_{\text{Interactions}} + \epsilon_{i}$$

+ We will talk in more detail about this soon.

---
# Testing the overall effects
+ The goal of our $F$-tests for the overall effect of a condition or interaction, is to assess whether models which include all coefficients that code the condition improve the model.

+ Hopefully, this sounds familiar to you.
  + This is using incremental $F$ tests
  
+ To do this, we need to define a set of models:

```{r}
m1 <- lm(SWB ~ Treatment, data = hosp_tbl)
m2 <- lm(SWB ~ Hospital, data = hosp_tbl)
m3 <- lm(SWB ~ Treatment + Hospital, data = hosp_tbl)
m4 <- lm(SWB ~ Treatment + Hospital + Treatment*Hospital, data = hosp_tbl)
```


---
# Testing the overall effects

+ For the effect of `Treatment`:

```{r}
m2 <- lm(SWB ~ Hospital, data = hosp_tbl)
m3 <- lm(SWB ~ Treatment + Hospital, data = hosp_tbl)
anova(m2,m3)
```

+ An effect of Treatment

---
# Testing the overall effects

+ For the effect of `Hospital`:

```{r}
m1 <- lm(SWB ~ Treatment, data = hosp_tbl)
m3 <- lm(SWB ~ Treatment + Hospital, data = hosp_tbl)
anova(m1,m3)
```

+ No effect of hospital

---
# Testing the overall effects

+ For the effect of interaction:

```{r}
m3 <- lm(SWB ~ Treatment + Hospital, data = hosp_tbl)
m4 <- lm(SWB ~ Treatment + Hospital + Treatment*Hospital, data = hosp_tbl)
anova(m3,m4)
```

+ An interaction

---
# Testing the overall effects
+ Using `anova()`:

```{r}
m4 <- lm(SWB ~ Treatment + Hospital + Treatment*Hospital, data = hosp_tbl)
anova(m4)
```

+ The values are not identical (there are some devils in detail), but you can see the pattern of results is the same in both approaches.

---
# Summary of today

+ Look at constructing $F$-tests for the overall effect of conditions (categorical variables) from a factorial design.

+ Now we can move on to consider the interaction term in more detail.
