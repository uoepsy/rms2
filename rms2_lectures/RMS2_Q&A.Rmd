# ASKING QUESTIONS
+ Please type all questions into the text chat.

+ Please wait to ask questions until asked to do so. 
  + This makes it easier for us to keep track.
  + I will stop and give lots of chances.

+ When I do, please type them into the chat.
  + Keep an eye in case the question has been asked already.

# CONCERNS
+ As we move through, things highlighted in red are summary topics/questions from the Padlet and survey.

+ **Will we be mad if you are slow?**
  + 100%, categorically no.
  + We know this isn't the easiest content for many
  + We try hard to make it accessible.
  + But we completely understand there will be lots of questions and will always do all we can to answer them (see later on support)

---
# IMPACT OF 2019-20
+ **Material missed or interrupted this year being crucial**
  + Yes this course will build on last year BUT we have taken steps to adjust content given circumstances.
  + All stats now in one course (planned for 21-22, made sense to move)
  + Very practical focus
  + We will go over some content again.
  + And recap materials will be provided.
  
---
# WORKLOAD
+ Always an estimate and will vary by person.
+ ~ 6-10hrs a week.

  + This may be the most structured we have ever been!
  
+ Lectures
  + Recorded, with exercises.

+ Labs
  + Self-directed learning with supported drop-ins
  + Lecturer office hours

# DROP-IN'S AND PEER SUPPORT
+ **Not being able to ask questions as we work though**
  + We hope we have made enough spaces that you will be able to.
  
+ 4 drop-in's per week.

+ In principle, you can attend them all
  + But, we need to have a bit of a trust/honour system.
  + If you have attended already in the week, and the session gets very full, allow others to ask questions

+ Open course room
  + Come and study any time.
  + If it is always full, we may have capacity issues, but I dont think this will happen.
  + Arrange with others to study togther here.
  + Discussion forum thread to find study partners at times that work for you all.

# ASSESSMENT
**When do we have tests, how often?**
+ Quizzes
  + Every week. 
  + Week 1 is practice.
  + There are 9 assessed quizzes. 
  + Always released on a Monday at 9am, close Sunday at 5pm GMT.
  + You have 1 hr to complete each test. 
  +~10 MCQ questions each time (sometimes fewer)
  + Best 7/9 scores are averaged to be your quiz mark.
  + Worth 25% overall grade.

+ **What happens if we miss a test?**
  + You can miss 4, or performing worse than you would have liked, and it has no impact (14/18)
  + If you miss more, and have reasons of suitable magnitude you can submit special circumstances
  + Otherwise it lowers your grade.

---
# ASSESSMENT
+ **No chance for improvement with single coursework**
  + This was a tough decision made over the summer.
  + Course usually has an exam, but we chose to remove it.
  + Decided not to have 2nd coursework, but to increase value of quizzes, and have a single report.
  
+ **What support will you have?**
  + All the usual support plus the chance for formative feedback
  + We will provide a lab exercise that you can use as a practice write up and receive formative feedback.


---
# ASSESSMENT
+ **When are the report deadlines?**
  + On LEARN dashboard there is a button for assessment. 
  + We will put all information on reports here.
  + We will add the deadlines this week
  + And let you know as and when we add details of the assessments.
