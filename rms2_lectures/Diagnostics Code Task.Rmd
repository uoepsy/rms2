OK, so the step by step in words for that code is as follows. The code is built one line at a time, with the description building underneath chunk and put together at the very end.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df %>%
```

Take the data frame `df` THEN

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df %>%
  mutate(
```

pass it to `mutate` 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df %>%
  mutate(
    hat = hatvalues(m1)
```

and add a new variale called `hat` which contains the hat values from `m1`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df %>%
  mutate(
    hat = hatvalues(m1)
  ) %>%

```

THEN

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df %>%
  mutate(
    hat = hatvalues(m1)
  ) %>%
  filter(., hat > 2*((1+1)/150)) %>%

```

Pass the object (which is now the original `df` with one added column called `hat`) to the `filter()` and filter those rows which have hat values greater than 2*((1+1)/150) THEN


```{r, eval=FALSE}
df %>%
  mutate(
    hat = hatvalues(m1)
  ) %>%
  filter(., hat > 2*((1+1)/150)) %>%
  kable(.)  %>%

```

Pass the `df` with only the rows that meet the filter criterion to `kable` THEN

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df %>%
  mutate(
    hat = hatvalues(m1)
  ) %>%
  filter(., hat > 2*((1+1)/150)) %>%
  kable(.)  %>%
  kable_styling(., full_width = F)
```

do some formatting

These last two lines will be unfamiliar, don't worry. `kable` and `kable_styling` are useful when presenting tables in slides and documents. They are not key for analysis. Well done if you looked these up.
